## An open-source, truly free QR code generator

Has this ever happened to you? You wanted to generate a QR code so you search "QR code generator" on Google, only to find pages and pages of results for predatory cash-grab sites that harass you to buy a subscription. Then even if you do find one that'll actually let you use it for free, maybe it gave you a QR code that hits their redirect link first so they can deactivate the code unless you pay up, or it spams your inbox asking for money no matter how many times you hit `unsubscribe`.

Well, I got fed up with all that, so I started this project to create a **simple, open-source, free-forever** QR code generator. *No* subscription fees, *no* personal information collection, *no* ads, and ***no BS***.

### Simple

openQR.net is designed to be versatile, yet easy to use. Just enter some text or a URL and it spits out a QR code for you to download and do whatever you want with.

### Open-Source

Anyone can review the source code and verify that no personal information is collected and no generated QR codes are stored after creation. openQR.net is made available under the [GNU GPL-v3 license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-gpl-3), which basically means you can do whatever you want with this site and my code, but anything you create with it must also be made open-source under the same license.

### Free Forever

This site will be completely free to use for as long as I live. No subscriptions, no memberships, and no nonsense. Just a reliable place to generate QR codes.

### Acknowledgements

openQR.net uses the [node-qrcode](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode) library, which is available under the [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).

Special thanks to the commercial QR code generator industry, one I'm still surprised exists, and without whose greedy shenanigans I would have never been inspired to make my own alternative.
