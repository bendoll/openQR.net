## An open-source, truly free QR code generator

Has this ever happened to you? You wanted to generate a QR code so you search "QR code generator" on Google, only to find pages and pages of results for predatory cash-grab sites that harass you to buy a subscription. Then even if you do find one that'll actually let you use it for free, maybe it gave you a QR code that hits their redirect link first so they can deactivate the code unless you pay up, or it spams your inbox asking for money no matter how many times you hit `unsubscribe`.

Well, I got fed up with all that, so I started this project to create a **simple, open-source, free-forever** QR code generator. Updates might come sporadically, or not at all, but at least for now it does one thing really well.
